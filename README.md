A repo of scripts that I can load up on my teensy.

Wat.
----

A [Teensy](http://pjrc.com/teensy/) is a $20 microcontroller that is essentially an Arduino lite (this time with 0 carbs!). Samyk recently made Hacker News with his [Teensy Driveby](https://github.com/samyk/usbdriveby), and Offensive Security has previously [done some work on the subject as well](https://github.com/offensive-security/hid-backdoor-peensy).

Naturally having an automated USB pentesting device is awesome, but I thought you could do a little more with it. This repository has all sorts of small scripts that can be used for testing and auditing of systems. More than just a autopwn device, the Teensy can be used for in-depth audits and vulnerability detection.

Anyways, it's just a fun device to satisfy my laziness.
